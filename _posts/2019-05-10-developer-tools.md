When you work as a developer or work on becoming one you ought to stay productive. This means to reduce distractions to a minimum and focus on your work. Choosing the right tools could help a lot, and by the right tools, I really mean the ones that do for you. Nowadays there is much choice, maybe even too much some would say, but in the end, it’s all a matter of preference. 
It is a bit confusing when you are just starting to make sense of the offers and I know it firsthand. For example, I kept changing text editors because none of the ones I tried looked or did everything exactly how I wanted. I eventually had to settle and chose the one I considered the best in the bunch. 
All this mumbo-jumbo about text editors (or other tools for that matter) might sound silly but it’s actually not. In my humble opinion, one should not waste a lot of time and energy on changing, reconfiguring and learning to use new tools because in the end, even if they come from different providers, they all do the same thing i.e. allow you to write, format and save text files (if we consider the example with the text editors). 
I always go with the principle that I can only recommend something if I tried it, or if I would buy/get it for myself. Thus, without further ado, here follows a list of what I currently use and, why not, like to work with.

### Editors/IDEs
Since we talked about text editors earlier, I’ll start there. The go-to utensil in my toolbox would be without a doubt Microsoft’s [Visual Studio Code](< https://code.visualstudio.com/>). It has a simple and easy to grasp interface, good git integration, access to the console directly from VS Code, problems listing and it’s very extensible. Yeah, if you find it lacking in some department, you can be quite sure that there’s an extension that might solve your problem. Not too long ago, I read an article saying that it had a high increase in popularity lately. Yes, it’s that good, and it’s also free. I also use [SublimeText](< https://www.sublimetext.com/>) as a secondary editor, mainly for ad-hoc script editing. It does not have the functionality of VS Code (at least not out-of-the-box), but I like its simplicity a lot. 
For data science or at least data-related projects, I use [Jupyter Lab](< https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab>), and find it to be great because it allows you to execute apps step by step and see the results or the errors that get generated. 
I also tried my hand with [PyCharm Community](< https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows>) and [Visual Studio 2019 Community](< https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/>) but, at least now, I find them to be too complicated.    

### Programming language(s)
As far as programming languages go, the choice is endless. If you want to do web development you absolutely have to know and use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You really don’t have much of a choice here. Other than those I mainly use Python and rarely R and VBA. 
I chose to work with Python because it’s relatively simple to get ahold of, has a large community of contributors that is only growing every day, and it’s very versatile. 
Its versatility is shown when you consider that it’s the main programming language used in data science, it’s also used in web development, testing, automation, etc. It basically does a bit of everything and it seems to be doing rather well. 
Last but not least, Python has a very large database of extensions for everything you can think of. There the SciPy package for scientific numerical calculations, pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for visualization, selenium integration for automation, Django/Flask for web development, etc. Give it a few years and someone will surely develop packages that cook your food or wash your laundry! 
Although it’s very good at a lot of things, the relationship with Python is not always a bed of roses. In some cases it’s slow, even painfully slow I’d say, and it also does not do multi-core or multi-thread processing.  The good news is that there are packages even for these cases like Cyton (for writing blazing fast extensions in C) and some libraries that enable multiprocessing. 
I use and recommend the [Anaconda](< https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section>) distribution, from Continuum Analytics. Not only is it very stable and well maintained, but it also comes with a very large array of extensions and tools in the installation kit. Thus, with one installation, you also get Jupyter, SciPy, pandas, matplotlib, SciKit-Learn, TensorFlow, VS Code, Spyder (an IDE developed specifically for data science), Orange (for data mining) and other goodies. As far as I remember it even comes with Flask preinstalled so you are ready to go on your development adventure.   

### Database
In the database department, you should definitely try [PostgreSQL](< https://www.postgresql.org/>) and [SQLite](< https://www.sqlite.org/index.html>). The first I use for more serious projects and the second for smaller ones. [DBeaver](<https://dbeaver.io/>) is a great DB exploration tool and I recommend it. 

### Data preparation/preprocessing
For initial data viewing and preparation (preprocessing, duplicate removal, correction of some inconsistencies), I use MS Excel, which is still a great tool these days. But the most added value I find in [OpenRefine](< http://openrefine.org/>) which does a lot of the heavy lifting for you in cleaning datasets. It’s a project supported by Google News, which should carry some weight. 

### Communication
Writing code is very important but also is communication. One has to remain in contact with clients, colleagues, mentors, etc. Even more so if the work is done remotely.  [Slack](< https://slack.com/>) is a great tool for teams and I’ve used it very successfully over a series of projects. If you also need to have screen-sharing sessions and/or videoconferences [zoom](< https://zoom.us/>) is great. In the free tier, you have a 40-minute time limit for the virtual meetings but, given that the trend these days is to reduce the duration of meetings of all kinds, I’d say it’s quite ok. For less important stuff, I also use [WhatsApp](< https://www.whatsapp.com/>). Yes, it dependent on your phone to work but it also runs on computers in web browsers, or in the dedicated app, it’s totally free, you can even send various types of files and it has an archive storing all that’s been transmitted. And as a bonus, the conversations are also encrypted. 

### More general aspects
To describe a bit my personal setup, I tend to have all my work stored in the cloud. The project repositories are on [GitHub](< https://github.com/>), which I chose simply because I already had an account created some time ago and it was comfortable. Should you not like it, try [GitLab](< https://about.gitlab.com/>) or [BitBucket](< https://bitbucket.org/>), I hear they are great.  
The other documents I mainly store on [Google Drive](< https://www.google.com/drive/>), and any notes, thoughts, plans and to do lists in [Keep](< https://keep.google.com/>) or [Trello](< https://trello.com/>), depending on their nature. 
I also make use of the other Google tools like Sheets and [Gmail](< https://mail.google.com>). I find them to be to my liking.  
As far as OS goes, I work on multiple machines, on Windows 10, Ubuntu (on [WSL](< https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10>)) and MacOS X Mojave so having everything online certainly helps. [Git](< https://git-scm.com/>) is also a precious resource here, helping me to keep my work in order. 
I have installed all major browsers ([Chrome](< https://www.google.com/chrome/>), [Firefox](< https://www.mozilla.org/ro/firefox/new/>) and [Opera](< https://www.opera.com/>); Safari on Mac). The main one though would be Chrome (yes, I have an inclination towards tools made in Google) as I’m accustomed to the [Chrome DevTools](< https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/>). 
Before closing, I have to mention in passing [Workbench](< https://workbench.developerforce.com/>) which is very useful in SalesForce related projects and [Grammarly](< https://app.grammarly.com/>) for checking spelling or grammatical errors in texts.  

### Closing notes
I would like to point out that, other than Excel, which you obviously a commercial program, all the other stuff I mentioned in this article is free, or they have a free tier. In fact, the only one I pay for is Google Drive’s 100GB option. 
Another important point is that the links are present only to help the readers find the tools described more easily and not for commercial purposes. But then again, they wouldn’t be paid publicity, would they… as my blog is still fresh out of the oven ?   
Lately I have been exploring with a range of interesting stuff among which [WebAssembly](< https://webassembly.org/>), [Splunk](< https://www.splunk.com/>), [Jenkins](< https://jenkins.io/>) and others, and I would very much like to update this article periodically and, why not, do some separate tutorials so you might want to bookmark it because things are going to get interesting. 
In the meantime, I’d really like to know what you are using and why, so I invite you to leave a comment and tell me. 

Until the next time! Stay curious!
